The word also means "secret teaching"-secret, no doubt, because a teaching vouchsafed only to those who are spiritually ready to receive and profit by it.</li><li><strong class="progress">7%</strong>important characteristic arises from the fact that the Upanishads are the work of saints and seers. Their authors were concerned with reporting insights which came to them in thought or vision, not with making these insights superficially coherent. They were not builders of systems but recorders of experience.</li><li><strong class="progress">8%</strong>He who engages in these things attains to concentration And is no longer a slave to his passions; Devout, self-controlled, disciplined in spirit, He rises to fame and is a blessing to mankind.</li><li><strong class="progress">9%</strong>The real study, say the Upanishads, is not study of themselves but study of that "by which we realize the changeless." In other words, the real study in religion is firsthand experience of God.</li><li><strong class="progress">10%</strong>He who sees all beings in the Self, and the Self in all beings, hates none. To the illumined soul, the Self is all. For him who sees everywhere oneness, how can there be delusion or grief?</li><li><strong class="progress">10%</strong>They who devote themselves both to life in the world and to meditation, by life in the world overcome death, and by meditation achieve immortality.</li><li><strong class="progress">12%</strong>He truly knows Brahman who knows him as beyond knowledge; he who thinks that he knows, knows not. The ignorant think that Brahman is known, but the wise know him to be beyond knowledge.</li><li><strong class="progress">18%</strong>The ancient, effulgent being, the indwelling Spirit, subtle, deep-hidden in the lotus of the heart, is hard tc know. But the wise man, following the path of meditation, knows him, and is freed alike from pleasure and from pain.</li><li><strong class="progress">18%</strong>The Self, whose symbol is OM, is the omniscient Lord. He is not born. He does not die. He is neither cause nor effect. This Ancient One is un- borr., eternal, imperishable; though the body be destroyed, he is not killed.</li><li><strong class="progress">19%</strong>The Self is not known through study of the scriptures, nor through subtlety of the intellect, nor through much learning. But by him who longs for him is he known.'

Knowing him as such, one is freed from death.</li><li><strong class="progress">20%</strong>Fools follow the desires of the flesh and fall into the snare of all-encompassing death; but the wise, knowing the Self as eternal, seek not the things that pass away.</li><li><strong class="progress">21%</strong>What is within us is also without.

"The lower is knowledge of the Vedas (the Rik, the Sama, the Yajur, and the Atharva), and also of phonetics, ceremonials, grammar, etymology, metre, and astronomy. "The higher is knowledge of that by which one knows the changeless reality. By this is fully revealed to the wise that which transcends the senses, which is uncaused, which is indefinable, which has neither eyes nor ears, neither hands nor feet, which is all-pervading, subtler than the subtlest-the everlasting, the source of all.</li><li><strong class="progress">33%</strong>wise, self-controlled, and tranquil souls-who are contented in spirit, and who practice austerity and meditation in solitude and silence-are freed from all impurity, and attain by the path of liberation to the immortal, the truly existing, the changeless Self.</li><li><strong class="progress">37%</strong>The Self is not to be known through study of the scriptures, nor through subtlety of the intellect, nor through much learning. But by him who longs for him is he known. Verily unto him does the Self reveal his true being.</li><li><strong class="progress">37%</strong>When death overtakes the body, the vital energy enters the cosmic source, the senses dissolve in their cause, and karmas and the individual soul are lost in Brahman, the pure, the changeless, the infinite.</li><li><strong class="progress">38%</strong>Whatsoever has existed, whatsoever exists, whatsoever shall exist hereafter, is OM.

It is pure unitary consciousness, wherein awareness of the world and of multiplicity is completely pletely obliterated. It is ineffable peace. It is the supreme good. It is One without a second.

This syllable, though indivisible, consists of three letters-A-U-M.</li><li><strong class="progress">47%</strong>everything that breathes, the beings that walk and the beings that walk not.

To Sanatkumara's question, "What have you already studied?" Narada replied that he had studied all the branches of learning-art, science, music, and philosophy, as well as the sacred scriptures. "But," said he, "I have gained no peace. I have studied all this, but the Self I do not know. I have heard from great teachers like you that he who knows the Self overcomes grief. Grief is ever my lot. Help me, I pray you, to overcome it." Sanatkumara said: "Whatever you have read is only name.

Thus he who has desire continues subject to rebirth.</li><li><strong class="progress">89%</strong>This vast universe is a wheel. Upon it are all creatures that are subject to birth, death, and rebirth. birth. Round and round it turns, and never stops. It is the wheel of Brahman. As long as the individual vidual self thinks it is separate from Brahman, it revolves upon the wheel in bondage to the laws of birth, death, and rebirth. But when through the grace of Brahman it realizes its identity with him, it revolves upon the wheel no longer. It achieves immortality.'</li><li><strong class="progress">91%</strong>Sit upright, holding the chest, throat, and head erect. Turn the senses and the mind inward to the lotus of the heart. Meditate on Brahman with the help of the syllable OM. Cross the fearful currents of the ocean of worldliness by means of the raft of Brahman-the sacred syllable OM. With earnest effort hold the senses in check. Controlling the breath, regulate the vital activities. As a charioteer holds back his restive horses, so does a persevering aspirant hold back his mind.</li><li><strong class="progress">92%</strong>As you become absorbed in meditation, you will realize that the Self is separate from the body and for this reason will not be affected by disease, old age, or death.
