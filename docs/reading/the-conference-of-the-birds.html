class="wrapper__content"><div class="header"><h2>The Great Simorgh Within</h2><p>17 May 2023</p></div><p>A magnificent tale that touches the very depths of your heart, that's what this beautifully written poetic masterpiece is. It is composed in the form of wonderful parables that narrate how a group of mystic birds overcome their greatest obstacles on the path toward their King, a mythical bird called the Great Simorgh. The main point Attar tries to convey is that this journey towards the Simorgh is actually a metaphor for an internal journey, and the only way to reach the end is by diving into your own psyche and spiritual essence.</p><p>The key is to meditate, fast, and focus on the level of resonance that characterizes divine love. This divine love is often mentioned by people who have experienced a near-death experience (NDE). I found the following statement by Attar to be the most important advice in the entire book.</p><blockquote>"Emerge from your confusion, find the inner seat of your humanity. There, a single breath will fill you with the answer to a hundred mysteries."</blockquote><p>I would interpret this as follows: "To bring clarity to your life, sit still and find your inner self by focusing on your breath. This will help solve many mysteries that lie within you." Yes, it is true. This simple yet incredibly effective action alone may help you find inner peace, and who knows, even enlightenment.</p><h2>Details</h2><ul><li>Paperback:‎ 384 pages</li><li>E-book: 384 pages</li><li>ISBN-10:‎ 0393355543</li><li>ISBN-13:‎ 978-0393355543</li></ul><h2>Where to buy?</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.betterworldbooks.com/product/detail/the-conference-of-the-birds-9780393355543" title="Buy The Conference Of The Birds at BetterWorldBooks" target="_blank">Buy The Conference Of The Birds at BetterWorldBooks</a></li><li><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-conference-of-the-birds-attar/8778427" title="Buy The Conference Of The Birds at The Bookshop.org" target="_blank">Buy The Conference Of The Birds at The Bookshop.org</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Conference-Birds-Attar/dp/0393355543" title="Buy The Conference Of The Birds at Amazon" target="_blank">Buy The Conference Of The Birds at Amazon</a></li></ul><h2>Summary</h2><p>"The Conference of the Birds" by Attar is a deeply spiritual piece of Persian literature. It is seen as a crowning achievement of Sufi thought. The narrative tells an epic journey undertaken by the birds of the world, who are led by the hoopoe. Their quest is to find the Simorgh, a mythical bird considered to be their sovereign.</p><p>The journey takes the birds across seven valleys, each symbolizing a step on the Sufi path: Search, Love, Knowledge, Detachment, Unity, Bewilderment, and Poverty and Annihilation. Each valley presents its own set of trials and tribulations, metaphorically representing human weaknesses, misconceptions, and spiritual obstacles. Many of the birds drop out, revealing the challenges in transcending individual ego and desires on the journey towards divine truth.</p><p>When the birds reach the end of their quest, only thirty remain. They discover a profound truth: these birds, all together are the Simorgh (Si means thirty, and morgh means bird in Persian). This final twist represents a powerful exploration of the mystical journey towards enlightenment and divine unity. The story culminates in the realization that the divine is not an external entity to be sought, but rather lies within. This emphasizes the significance of self-discovery and inner transformation in the path to enlightenment.</p><h2>Important learnings and insights</h2><ol><li><strong>Journey towards Self-discovery</strong><br />The allegorical journey of the birds symbolizes the human quest for self-discovery. The hardships faced along the way represent our internal struggles and fears that prevent us from recognizing our true potential and divine essence.</li><li><strong>Transcendence of Ego</strong><br />The birds that drop out of the quest symbolize individuals who are not ready to let go of their ego and personal desires. Attar suggests that one must transcend the ego and worldly attachments to truly encounter the divine.</li><li><strong>Inner Transformation</strong><br />The realization of the remaining thirty birds that they are, in fact, the Simorgh underscores the importance of inner transformation. It is a potent symbol for the idea that divinity or enlightenment is not an external force to be sought, but a state of being to realize within oneself.</li><li><strong>Unity with Divine</strong><br />The journey of the birds encapsulates the Sufi concept of unity with the divine, often termed as 'tawhid.' The realization that they themselves are the Simorgh represents achieving this state of spiritual oneness.</li><li><strong>Seven Stages of Spiritual Path</strong><br />The seven valleys represent the stages of the spiritual journey, each offering a unique insight. The challenges encountered in each stage serve as metaphors for different facets of human existence and spiritual progression, from the initiation of the search to the final annihilation of self in the divine.</li><li><strong>Importance of Spiritual Guide</strong><br />The hoopoe bird, acting as a guide for the other birds, represents the necessity of a spiritual guide or teacher (Sheikh or Murshid in Sufi tradition) who has already traversed the path and can help seekers on their spiritual journey.</li><li><strong>Perseverance and Faith</strong><br />Another crucial insight from "The Conference of the Birds" is the importance of perseverance and unwavering faith in the spiritual journey. As depicted through the challenging journey of the birds, the path towards enlightenment is fraught with obstacles and difficulties. Many give up, unable to see the journey to its end. Those who persevere, however, guided by their faith and commitment, ultimately achieve the coveted unity with the divine. This underscores the message that spiritual enlightenment demands dedication, patience, and resilience, alongside a deep, unshakeable faith.</li></ol><h2>61 significant notes</h2><p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/notes/33406594-the-conference-of-the-birds/42193292-thomas-torfs" target="_blank">View these notes on Goodreads</a></p><ul class="notes"><li><strong class="progress">1%</strong>The parables in this book trigger memories deep within us all.

And since suffering is born out of love, love is also the destroyer of ego. When the ego is annihilated, the inner eye blinks open.</li><li><strong class="progress">1%</strong>Attar, Sheikh Farīd-Ud-Dīn, (1145–1220 CE), was born in Nishapur (Nīšāpūr), a city in the northeast region of Iran.</li><li><strong class="progress">1%</strong>The Conference of the Birds (Manteq al-Tayr) is an allegorical poem about our human struggle, both physical and spiritual.</li><li><strong class="progress">2%</strong>The central idea in the Sufi movement is that the soul, in the prison of the body, awaits release.

This reunion can be experienced while we are still bound by the body through looking inward and through purification.</li><li><strong class="progress">2%</strong>The birds of the world, representing the mystics, gather and acknowledge the Great Simorgh as their King.

Some arrive at it as pure drops of water, enter, are absorbed, and become one with the Ocean; others arrive trapped inside themselves, egos intact, and enter the welcoming Ocean as well. However, they sink to its depths and remain there, knowing only themselves, never the Ocean.</li><li><strong class="progress">4%</strong>Do not read it as the psychoanalytical ego, minted by the nineteenth-century neurologist and father of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud. Here, ego does not equal identity. The term used in this book comes from the Latin root, ē'gō, meaning “I,” “the self that feels, acts, or thinks.” It is our lower self, the upholder of self-righteousness and self-proclaimed truths.</li><li><strong class="progress">4%</strong>Although all paths eventually lead to the Beloved, the annihilation of the ego shortens the path to the Source.</li><li><strong class="progress">4%</strong>Regarding the Divine, the Source can arguably stand for God, Allah, Jehovah, Dios, Jah, or any other Supreme Being by any other name worshipped by various faiths of the world.

The only true sultan is the World-Keeping Sovereign.
