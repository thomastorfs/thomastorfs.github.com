    h2 Short and truly remarkable

    p Once in a while you stumble on short literature which really makes a difference. This book is such an example. It accompanies the writings of the Emerald Tablet without blatantly over-analyzing its substance. It lays a foundation for you and helps you distill its abstract yet deep and meaningful contents.
    
    p My take, read it! It will be the best time you ever spent on a spiritual book, especially because it's so short yet oh so important.

            | Instead of Alchemy representing a literal transformation of a base metal like lead or mercury into gold, I believe it represents the transformation of a base human being, ignorant and full of ego, into something of a higher nature- a spiritually matured, knowledgeable, compassionate and enlightened human being.

            | the inner teaching is that the jihad is actually a war within you- a war between what is good and right within you versus your inner darkness. Another way of expressing this idea is that the inner war is between your self-centered ego and your higher self.

            | Over time, and possibly over many lifetimes, we eventually ripen and mature into a being of higher nature. This is Alchemy. Once we ripen and mature to a certain point, it is time to move on to the next realm after death.
