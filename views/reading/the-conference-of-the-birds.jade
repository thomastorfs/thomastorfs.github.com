        h2 A Journey Towards The Great Simorgh Within
        p #{dateFull}
    
    p A magnificent tale that touches your heart deep into its core, that's what this beautifully written poetic masterpiece is. It is written in the form of wonderful parables narrating how a group of characteristic birds overcome their most difficult obstacles on the path toward their King, a mythical bird called the Great Simorgh. The main point Attar tries to make is that this path toward Simorgh actually is a metaphor for a path that lies within yourself, and the only way to reach it is to dive within your own psyche and spiritual being. 
    
    p The key is to meditate, fast and focus on the level of resonance which characterizes divine love. This divine love is the love most people who experienced an NDE talk about. I found the following statement by Attar to be the main key of the story.
    
    blockquote Emerge from your confusion, find the inner seat of your humanity. There, a single breath will fill you with the answer to a hundred mysteries.
    
    p I would translate this as follows: "To bring more clarity to your life, sit still and find your inner self by focusing on your breath. This will help answer many mysteries that lie within yourself." Yes, it is true, this simple yet very effective action alone may just help you find inner peace, and who knows, even enlightenment.

    h2 Summary
    
    p "The Conference of the Birds" by Attar is a deeply spiritual piece of Persian literature. It is seen as a crowning achievement of Sufi thought. The narrative tells an epic journey undertaken by the birds of the world, who are led by the hoopoe. Their quest is to find the Simorgh, a mythical bird considered to be their sovereign.

    p The journey takes the birds across seven valleys, each symbolizing a step on the Sufi path: Search, Love, Knowledge, Detachment, Unity, Bewilderment, and Poverty and Annihilation. Each valley presents its own set of trials and tribulations, metaphorically representing human weaknesses, misconceptions, and spiritual obstacles. Many of the birds drop out, revealing the challenges in transcending individual ego and desires on the journey towards divine truth.

    p When the birds reach the end of their quest, only thirty remain. They discover a profound truth: these birds, all together are the Simorgh (Si means thirty, and morgh means bird in Persian). This final twist represents a powerful exploration of the mystical journey towards enlightenment and divine unity. The story culminates in the realization that the divine is not an external entity to be sought, but rather lies within. This emphasizes the significance of self-discovery and inner transformation in the path to enlightenment.

    h2 Important learnings and insights

    ol
        li <strong>Journey towards Self-discovery</strong><br />The allegorical journey of the birds symbolizes the human quest for self-discovery. The hardships faced along the way represent our internal struggles and fears that prevent us from recognizing our true potential and divine essence.
        li <strong>Transcendence of Ego</strong><br />The birds that drop out of the quest symbolize individuals who are not ready to let go of their ego and personal desires. Attar suggests that one must transcend the ego and worldly attachments to truly encounter the divine.
        li <strong>Inner Transformation</strong><br />The realization of the remaining thirty birds that they are, in fact, the Simorgh underscores the importance of inner transformation. It is a potent symbol for the idea that divinity or enlightenment is not an external force to be sought, but a state of being to realize within oneself.
        li <strong>Unity with Divine</strong><br />The journey of the birds encapsulates the Sufi concept of unity with the divine, often termed as 'tawhid.' The realization that they themselves are the Simorgh represents achieving this state of spiritual oneness.
        li <strong>Seven Stages of Spiritual Path</strong><br />The seven valleys represent the stages of the spiritual journey, each offering a unique insight. The challenges encountered in each stage serve as metaphors for different facets of human existence and spiritual progression, from the initiation of the search to the final annihilation of self in the divine.
        li <strong>Importance of Spiritual Guide</strong><br />The hoopoe bird, acting as a guide for the other birds, represents the necessity of a spiritual guide or teacher (Sheikh or Murshid in Sufi tradition) who has already traversed the path and can help seekers on their spiritual journey.
        li <strong>Perseverance and Faith</strong><br />Another crucial insight from "The Conference of the Birds" is the importance of perseverance and unwavering faith in the spiritual journey. As depicted through the challenging journey of the birds, the path towards enlightenment is fraught with obstacles and difficulties. Many give up, unable to see the journey to its end. Those who persevere, however, guided by their faith and commitment, ultimately achieve the coveted unity with the divine. This underscores the message that spiritual enlightenment demands dedication, patience, and resilience, alongside a deep, unshakeable faith.
