            | Each individual is assigned an Overseer who volunteers for the position, before they come to Earth. The function of an Overseer is to ‘check’ on you through various stages of your life journey and to ensure that all is going according to plan. The Overseer holds a copy of the blueprint of your life plan and genetic structures and will alert you if there is any interference in these plans that may block you from being all that you are meant to be. Your Overseer keeps you on the right track and doesn’t allow you to divert yourself too much.
