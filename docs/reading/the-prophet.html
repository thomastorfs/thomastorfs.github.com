It holds many wonderful insights. I received the Dutch translation as a gift. Funny thing is, the final chapter, written by the translator puts the reader's feet back on the ground. Yes, the book is a masterpiece, but the idea you may have of the spiritual American-Arabic writer may be different from who he was in reality. For example, Gibran lived in Boston since he was 12 and eventually left the world as an alcoholic. </p><p>The translator, Désanne van Brederode, writes about her own life and her experience growing up in a new-age environment where the search for spirituality was colored by glimpses of hypocrisy. At the same time, she explains how true spirituality was found in corners where you would least expect it. This, in my opinion, was the most beautiful and eye-opening concluding chapter of any spiritual book I've read to date.</p><h2>Details</h2><ul><li>Paperback:‎ 64 pages</li><li>E-book: 89 pages</li><li>ISBN-10:‎ 1441338365</li><li>ISBN-13:‎ 978-1441338365</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Prophet-Kahlil-Gibran/dp/1441338365" title="Buy The Prophet at Amazon" target="_blank">Buy The Prophet at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/the-prophet/28883093/item/#edition=60027851&amp;idiq=53938189" title="Buy The Prophet at Thriftbooks" target="_blank">Buy The Prophet at Thriftbooks</a></li><li><a href="https://www.betterworldbooks.com/product/detail/the-prophet-9781441338365" title="Buy The Prophet at BetterWorldBooks" target="_blank">Buy The Prophet at BetterWorldBooks</a></li></ul><h2>37 significant notes</h2><p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/notes/61652074-the-prophet/42193292-thomas-torfs" title="View highlights on Goodreads" target="_blank">View these highlights on Goodreads</a></p><ul class="notes"><li><strong class="progress">4%</strong>Who alone are peace and freedom to the river and the stream, Only another winding will this stream make, only another murmur in this glade, And then shall I come to you, a boundless drop to a boundless ocean.</li><li><strong class="progress">5%</strong>Am I a harp that the hand of the mighty may touch me, or a flute that his breath may pass through me? A seeker of silences am I, and what treasure have I found in silences that I may dispense with confidence?</li><li><strong class="progress">10%</strong>For even as love crowns you so shall he crucify you. Even as he is for your growth so is he for your pruning. Even as he ascends to your height and caresses your tenderest branches that quiver in the sun, So shall he descend to your roots and shake them in their clinging to the earth.</li><li><strong class="progress">12%</strong>When you love you should not say, “God is in my heart,” but rather, “I am in the heart of God.”</li><li><strong class="progress">15%</strong>Give your hearts, but not into each other’s keeping. For only the hand of Life can contain your hearts.</li><li><strong class="progress">19%</strong>It is well to give when asked, but it is better to give unasked, through understanding;</li><li><strong class="progress">24%</strong>When you work you are a flute through whose heart the whispering of the hours turns to music.</li><li><strong class="progress">26%</strong>And what is it to work with love? It is to weave the cloth with threads drawn from your heart, even as if your beloved were to wear that cloth.</li><li><strong class="progress">28%</strong>Your joy is your sorrow unmasked.</li><li><strong class="progress">30%</strong>Some of you say, “Joy is greater than sorrow,” and others say, “Nay, sorrow is the greater.” But I say unto you, they are inseparable.</li><li><strong class="progress">30%</strong>Only when you are empty are you at standstill and balanced.</li><li><strong class="progress">33%</strong>Verily the lust for comfort murders the passion of the soul, and then walks grinning in the funeral.</li><li><strong class="progress">35%</strong>And when his work was done he laughed in the forest. Forget not that modesty is for a shield against the eye of the unclean.</li><li><strong class="progress">36%</strong>It is in exchanging the gifts of the earth that you shall find abundance and be satisfied. Yet unless the exchange be in love and kindly justice, it will but lead some to greed and others to hunger.</li><li><strong class="progress">38%</strong>It is when your spirit goes wandering upon the wind, That you, alone and unguarded, commit a wrong unto others and therefore unto yourself.</li><li><strong class="progress">39%</strong>the ocean is your god-self; It remains for ever undefiled. And like the ether it lifts but the winged. Even like the sun is your god-self;</li><li><strong class="progress">43%</strong>What penalty lay you upon him who slays in the flesh yet is himself slain in the spirit?</li><li><strong class="progress">44%</strong>And that the corner-stone of the temple is not higher than the lowest stone in its foundation.</li><li><strong class="progress">44%</strong>You delight in laying down laws, Yet you delight more in breaking them. children playing by the ocean who build sand-towers with constancy and then destroy them with laughter.</li><li><strong class="progress">51%</strong>For reason, ruling alone, is a force confining; and passion, unattended, is a flame that burns to its own destruction.</li><li><strong class="progress">53%</strong>Your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding.</li><li><strong class="progress">54%</strong>Your hearts know in silence the secrets of the days and the nights.

The soul unfolds itself, like a lotus of countless petals.</li><li><strong class="progress">56%</strong>The teacher who walks in the shadow of the temple, among his followers, gives not of his wisdom but rather of his faith and his lovingness. If he is indeed wise he does not bid you enter the house of his wisdom, but rather leads you to the threshold of your own mind.</li><li><strong class="progress">58%</strong>Your friend is your needs answered. He is your field which you sow with love and reap with thanksgiving.</li><li><strong class="progress">59%</strong>And let your best be for your friend. If he must know the ebb of your tide, let him know its flood also.</li><li><strong class="progress">60%</strong>You talk when you cease to be at peace with your thoughts; And when you can no longer dwell in the solitude of your heart you live in your lips, and sound is a diversion and a pastime.</li><li><strong class="progress">62%</strong>Yet the timeless in you is aware of life’s timelessness, And knows that yesterday is but today’s memory and tomorrow is today’s dream.</li><li><strong class="progress">67%</strong>You pray in your distress and in your need; would that you might pray also in the fullness of your joy and in your days of abundance. For what is prayer but the expansion of yourself into the living ether?</li><li><strong class="progress">70%</strong>Pleasure is a freedom-song, But it is not freedom.

But you are life and you are the veil. Beauty is eternity gazing at itself in a mirror. But you are eternity and you are the mirror.</li><li><strong class="progress">78%</strong>All your hours are wings that beat through space from self to self. He who wears his morality but as his best garment were better naked.</li><li><strong class="progress">79%</strong>Your daily life is your temple and your religion.
