The book presents the core teachings of Hermes Trismegistus, a legendary figure who is considered the father of Hermeticism. This ancient wisdom tradition merges Greek philosophy with Egyptian mysticism, focusing on the pursuit of divine knowledge and the understanding of the universe.</p><p>The work is composed of 17 treatises, which explore topics such as the nature of God, the creation of the universe, the human soul, and the practice of alchemy. Central to these teachings is the concept of "as above, so below," which emphasizes the connection between the microcosm (the individual) and the macrocosm (the universe). The book also underscores the importance of spiritual growth, self-awareness, and inner transformation in the quest for enlightenment.</p><p>In essence, "The Divine Pymander of Hermes Mercurius Trismegistus" serves as a guide for those seeking to understand and master the secrets of the universe. It highlights the importance of attaining wisdom and spiritual development in order to achieve a harmonious relationship with the divine.</p><h2>Important learnings and insights</h2><ol><li><strong>The Principle of Correspondence</strong><br />The famous Hermetic axiom "as above, so below" underlines the interconnectedness between the microcosm (individual) and the macrocosm (universe). This principle suggests that understanding the patterns and laws governing the cosmos can help individuals understand themselves better and achieve personal transformation.</li><li><strong>The Nature of God and Creation</strong><br />The book explains that God is an all-encompassing, eternal, and omnipresent force that exists within and beyond creation. It asserts that the universe was created through divine thought, with matter and spirit intertwined in a continuous process of emanation and manifestation.</li><li><strong>The Human Soul and Spiritual Growth</strong><br />The text emphasizes the divine nature of the human soul, which is considered a reflection of God. It advocates for spiritual growth and self-awareness as essential components in achieving enlightenment and harmony with the divine.</li><li><strong>The Practice of Alchemy</strong><br />The book explores alchemy not only as a means to transform base metals into gold but also as a metaphor for spiritual transformation. Alchemy symbolizes the process of refining the human soul and spirit to reach a higher state of existence.</li><li><strong>The Power of Mind and Thought</strong><br />Hermeticism places great importance on the power of thought and mental faculties. The book teaches that individuals can shape their reality and influence the material world through focused intention and the cultivation of a disciplined mind.</li><li><strong>The Pursuit of Divine Knowledge</strong><br />The ultimate goal of Hermeticism is the attainment of divine knowledge or Gnosis. This wisdom transcends ordinary human understanding and can only be gained through direct experience of the divine, often achieved through meditation, contemplation, or other spiritual practices.</li><li><strong>The Law of Polarity</strong><br />The book highlights the concept of duality and the existence of opposing forces in the universe. It teaches that understanding the relationship between these opposites, such as light and darkness or good and evil, can lead to a more balanced and harmonious existence.</li><li><strong>Reincarnation and the Afterlife</strong><br />Hermeticism believes in the transmigration of souls and the process of reincarnation. The book suggests that through multiple lifetimes, individuals can learn from their experiences, grow spiritually, and ultimately reunite with the divine source.</li><li><strong>Divine Intervention and Destiny</strong><br />The text acknowledges the role of divine intervention in human affairs and the existence of a predetermined destiny. However, it also emphasizes the importance of individual choice, responsibility, and free will in shaping one's life and spiritual journey.</li><li><strong>The Seven Hermetic Principles</strong><br />Though not explicitly detailed in "The Divine Pymander," these principles are foundational to Hermetic philosophy and can be inferred from the book's teachings. The seven principles are Mentalism (all is mind), Correspondence (as above, so below), Vibration (everything vibrates), Polarity (everything has opposites), Rhythm (everything has its cycles), Cause and Effect (the law of karma), and Gender (masculine and feminine principles exist in all things). Understanding these principles can help individuals grasp the workings of the universe and apply this knowledge to their own lives.</li></ol><h2>52 significant notes</h2><p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/notes/28423360-the-divine-pymander-of-hermes-mercurius-trismegistus/42193292-thomas-torfs" target="_blank">View these notes on Goodreads</a></p><ul class="notes"><li><strong class="progress">2%</strong>Hermes, for he was the first Intelligencer in the World (as we read of) that communicated Knowledge to the sons of Men, by Writing, or Engraving.</li><li><strong class="progress">2%</strong>he was King of Egypt.</li><li><strong class="progress">2%</strong>he was named Ter Maximus: for being preferred [Franciscus Flussas] (according to the Egyptian Customs) being chief Philosopher, to be chief of the Priesthood: and from thence, to be chief in Government, or King.</li><li><strong class="progress">2%</strong>he was called Ter Maximus; for having perfect, and exact Knowledge of all things contained in the World; which things he divided into Three Kingdoms (as he calls them), viz., Mineral, Vegetable, Animal;</li><li><strong class="progress">2%</strong>it is received amongst the Ancients, that he was the first that invented the Art of communicating Knowledge to the World, by Writing or Engraving.

But all men are subject to Fate, and to Generation, and Change, for these are the beginning and end of Fate or Destiny</li><li><strong class="progress">68%</strong>First, if, O Son, thou shalt diligently withdraw thyself from all contentious speeches, thou shalt find that in Truth, the Mind, the Soul of God bears rule over all things, both over Fate, and Law, and all other things.</li><li><strong class="progress">69%</strong>Everything that moveth is incorporeal; everything that is moved is a Body; and it is moved into the Bodies by the Mind. Now, Motion is passion, and there they both suffer; as well that which moveth, as that which is moved, as well that which ruleth, as that which is ruled.</li><li><strong class="progress">73%</strong>For Generation is not a Creation of Life, but a production of things to Sense, and making them manifest. Neither is Change Death, but an Occultation of hiding of that which was.</li><li><strong class="progress">78%</strong>The things most apparent are Evil, but the Good is secret, or hid in, or to the things that appear, for it hath neither Form nor Figure.</li><li><strong class="progress">80%</strong>For Divinity is… from under God, and Understanding from the Mind, being the Sister of the Word or Speech, and they the Instruments one of another. 7.
