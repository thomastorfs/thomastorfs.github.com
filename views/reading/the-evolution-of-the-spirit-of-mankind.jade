    p There's something about the contents of this book that sets it apart, in the most positive sense you can think of. At first sight, I was convinced it was just an easily digestible collection of transcriptions from recorded sessions by the gifted medium Julie Macdonald. However, it will become apparent rather quickly that these transcriptions contain fundamental wisdom, the very wisdom we need to foster in order to grow, not just as a single Soul, but as the combined consciousness of all Souls gathered here on Earth.

    p Julie brings us more than just a few messages. These messages originate from something that is called "The 82nd Regime Of Light-Workers". Think of this so-called Regime as a form of bundled energy and consciousness. They are here to help evolve all Souls living on Earth. They are here to help us "wake up further". Whether you believe this or not, this book truly succeeds in helping achieve this goal by communicating rather difficult life lessons in an easily digestible and beautifully put-together book. Thank you for sharing your gift with us Julie.
