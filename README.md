# Thomas Torfs Portfolio

Hi, I am Thomas. I have more than 15 years of professional experience in programming and design. Continuous learning and participating in the creation of a better world for both humanity and the environment are two of my core values. I strive to apply both of these core values in all current and future cooperations.
