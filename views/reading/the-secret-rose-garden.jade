    h2 Pure excellence in spiritual poetry

    p This book reminds me of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix' title='View The Matrix on Wikipedia' target='_blank'>The Matrix</a>. In the movie Morpheus mentions: "The Matrix is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth." This is exactly what it feels like when you read this book and start putting it into practice. Morpheus also mentions: "Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself." 
    
    p Of course, The Secret Rose Garden is a lot more refined and pure than the action movie, but it could give you a hint of the level and depth of insight you may be confronted with. Go read this marvel and see for yourself through <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vipassanā' target='_blank' title='Visit the Wikipedia page about Vipassana meditation'>dedicated meditation</a>.

            | The Visit One day at the dawn the fair idol entered my door and woke me from my sleep of slothful ignorance. The secret chamber of my soul was illumined by his face, and my being was revealed to me in its true light. I heaved a sigh of wonder when I saw that fair face. He spoke to me, saying, “All your life you have sought name and fame; this self - seeking of yours is an illusion, keeping you back from me. To glance at my face for an instant is worth a thousand years of devotion.” Yes, the face of that world adorner was shown unveiled before mine eyes; my soul was darkened with shame to remember my lost life, my wasted days.
