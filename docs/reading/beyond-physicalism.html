Kelly is a groundbreaking book that challenges the materialistic worldview and advocates for a more holistic understanding of reality. The authors propose a new scientific paradigm called "post-materialist science," which incorporates both material and non-material aspects of reality, drawing from various disciplines such as physics, biology, psychology, and philosophy. </p><p>Central to the book is the idea that consciousness is a fundamental aspect of the universe, not an emergent property of matter. The authors present evidence for psi phenomena, near-death experiences, and other transformative experiences, suggesting the existence of a spiritual dimension of reality. </p><p>The book emphasizes the importance of integrating science and spirituality for a more comprehensive understanding of reality, and explores the alignment between spiritual traditions and emerging scientific insights. By challenging the dominant materialistic paradigm, "Beyond Physicalism" encourages readers to reevaluate their understanding of reality and consider the profound implications of a more integrated approach.</p><h2>Important learnings and insights</h2><ol><li><strong>Limitations of materialism</strong><br />The book highlights the limitations of the materialistic paradigm, which has not been able to fully explain consciousness, psi phenomena, and other anomalous experiences. This demonstrates the need for an alternative framework that can account for these phenomena.</li><li><strong>Post-materialist science</strong><br />The authors propose a new scientific paradigm called "post-materialist science" that incorporates both the material and non-material aspects of reality. This approach offers a more comprehensive understanding of the nature of reality.</li><li><strong>Consciousness as fundamental</strong><br />A central insight of the book is the idea that consciousness is not an emergent property of matter, but rather a fundamental aspect of the universe. This challenges the widely held view that consciousness arises from complex physical processes in the brain.</li><li><strong>Psi phenomena</strong><br />The book delves into various psi phenomena, such as telepathy, precognition, and psychokinesis, presenting evidence that supports their existence and challenges materialistic assumptions. These phenomena suggest the presence of non-material aspects of reality and point to a deeper understanding of the nature of consciousness.</li><li><strong>Near-death experiences (NDEs) and transformative experiences</strong><br />The authors examine NDEs and other transformative experiences as evidence for a spiritual dimension of reality. These experiences offer insights into the nature of consciousness and suggest that our understanding of reality extends beyond the physical world.</li><li><strong>Integration of science and spirituality</strong><br />"Beyond Physicalism" emphasizes the importance of integrating scientific knowledge with spiritual insights to achieve a more complete understanding of reality. This integration could lead to transformative changes in our worldview and have profound implications for the future of humanity.</li><li><strong>Alignment of spiritual traditions with emerging science</strong><br />The book explores the relationship between various spiritual traditions and the emerging scientific understanding of the non-material aspects of reality. This demonstrates that many spiritual insights align with the scientific findings, further supporting the case for an integrated approach to understanding reality.</li></ol><h2>97 highlights</h2><p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/notes/25014973-beyond-physicalism/42193292-thomas-torfs?ref=abp" title="View highlights on Goodreads" target="_blank">View these highlights on Goodreads</a></p><ul class="notes"><li><strong class="progress">1%</strong>In contrast with the prevailing production model of the brain/mind relation, as described above, these “rogue” data collectively support an alternative class of models which view the brain not as the generator of mind and consciousness but as an organ of adaptation to the everyday environment, selecting, focusing, channeling, and constraining the operations of a mind and consciousness inherently far greater in capacities and scope.</li><li><strong class="progress">1%</strong>in the words of Francis Bacon (1620/1960), at the dawn of modern science, “[T]he world is not to be narrowed till it will go into the understanding ... but the understanding to be expanded and opened till it can take in the image of the world as it is in fact”</li><li><strong class="progress">2%</strong>think of traditional religions in terms of the familiar parable of the blind men and the elephant, each in touch with aspects of a tremendous and objectively existent reality, but all suffering from characteristically human limitations of perspective and none in position to claim exclusive possession of the truth in its entirety.</li><li><strong class="progress">2%</strong>The mystical traditions themselves, with their practical emphasis on personal liberation, tend to value experience over doctrine and theory.</li><li><strong class="progress">2%</strong>We have no interest in fighting rearguard actions against entrenched psi-deniers and scientific fundamentalists and the like, important though such efforts undoubtedly are, and we are not apologetic about prospecting in the literature of mystical experience and mystically informed religious philosophies for clues about how best to advance our theoretical purposes.</li><li><strong class="progress">3%</strong>Wolfgang Pauli in collaboration with psychologist Carl Gustav Jung, according to which the physical and mental aspects of the experienced world are complementary,</li><li><strong class="progress">3%</strong>hyperdimensional or hyperspace theories as conceived by persons such as philosopher C.

Matter is not that which produces consciousness, but that which limits it and confines its intensity within certain limits: material organization does not construct consciousness out of arrangements of atoms, but contracts its manifestation within the sphere which it permits.

The great assumption: the Supreme Reality dispensed its insights universally; philosophy was to blaze a dialectical trail to the unifying, harmonizing core of all the traditions.</li><li><strong class="progress">19%</strong>There are various ways the model can be tried, tested, and used experimentally. One is the traditional way, using established spiritual practices like prayer, fasting, meditation, and so on, all widely employed to induce experiences associated with spiritual enlightenment and creative inspiration. Many of the techniques are designed to reduce resistance to the subliminal influx; they lower Fechner’s threshold, allowing what is present to present itself with minimal impediment.</li><li><strong class="progress">19%</strong>Experiments are built around reducing sensori-somatic noise, with the key idea of deafferentation: cutting off sensory input by using techniques of meditation, hypnosis, sensory deprivation, progressive muscular relaxation, induced hypnagogia, and Ganzfeld (uniform sensory input).</li><li><strong class="progress">21%</strong>The results obtained to date seem generally in line with the notion that lower levels of chronic “noise” or mental chatter go with better psi performance.</li><li><strong class="progress">22%</strong>Large amounts of historical and cross-cultural testimony also affirm the psi-conduciveness of meditation in various forms, and modern experimental results supporting the existence of such a connection have gradually accumulated (Honorton, 1977; Kelly & Locke, 1981/2009; Radin, 2013).</li><li><strong class="progress">26%</strong>the founders of quantum theory accepted the empiricist doctrine that science must be anchored in what we know.

They focused instead on the structure of these experiences themselves.</li><li><strong class="progress">27%</strong>Schrödinger equation, which is the quantum analog of the classical equations of motion that generate the actual future.

The inner psychic dissection becomes replaced by a dissected world view, which is unavoidable because without such discrimination no conscious knowledge would be possible.</li><li><strong class="progress">34%</strong>Methods for a systematic generation of acategorial states play a central role in the spiritual traditions of Asian cultures.

This is thought to be an inherent property of sattva, obscured or interfered with by the presence of tamasic and rajasic impurities of the internal organ, especially the buddhi, and hence it is progressively released or unfettered as full sattvification is approached, yielding supernormal perception and ultimately knowledge of everything in prakṛtic nature (YS III.34, 37;)</li><li><strong class="progress">55%</strong>Patañjali tells us that our actions, our karma, determine our species for our next life — that is, our bodies — along with our life span and pleasant and unpleasant experiences.</li><li><strong class="progress">56%</strong>Māyā thus is the complexity that makes up the world and everything that we see here. Māyā is the principle which allows for differentiation.

These “monads” are not the atoms of the materialists but complete perceptions of the universe organized from centers.</li><li><strong class="progress">60%</strong>Leibniz’s metaphysics makes paranormal cognitions normal, a natural feature of the way things are, and gives a fundamental place to the subconscious, an essential part of filter theory.</li><li><strong class="progress">63%</strong>That life should continue after death is to be expected in a monadological world.
