It is where an initiate connects both to the spiritual realms above and the holy realms within. The initiate remembers the higher plan for Earth as well as his/her own divine plan and purpose for being on Earth.</li><li><strong class="progress">7%</strong>We recognise that it is now time for humanity to understand these factors and transcend the fear of the unknown through the gaining of knowledge and awareness.</li><li><strong class="progress">7%</strong>As a Light-worker you have agreed to awaken earlier than others and clear the way for their unfolding.</li><li><strong class="progress">7%</strong>If you doubt whether you are a Light-worker, know this: if you were not, or were not yet ready for such information, you would not be attracted to this book.</li><li><strong class="progress">7%</strong>As you come to deeper levels of awareness, it can feel as though the previous levels you have known are incorrect. This is not the case as those previous levels were relevant at the time, however as you ascend you require new depth and insight.</li><li><strong class="progress">7%</strong>If at any time you require further assistance in your own development or in understanding the material, call upon us through the process of prayer and meditation.</li><li><strong class="progress">8%</strong>Many humans walk Earth with a very limited awareness of anything beyond their immediate experience. They are aware when they are hungry, tired, thirsty or in pain. Most people go beyond this and are aware when they are stressed, anxious, angry, happy or sad.</li><li><strong class="progress">8%</strong>there are others who know that there is more to life than what is seen or felt in the physical world. They dare to explore outside what is known and begin to investigate energetic realities.</li><li><strong class="progress">9%</strong>Do not be concerned if you do not understand your Hierarchy straight away. The real understanding comes through experiencing it yourself and the meditations will give you that opportunity.</li><li><strong class="progress">9%</strong>The Spiritual Hierarchy for Earth consists of twelve founding individual Hierarchies that were the first to act as the governing body of the planet. Over time the Spiritual Hierarchy for Earth received the membership of new Hierarchies from different parts of the galaxy. The founding members still remain as the Spiritual Hierarchy for Earth and are the core of the governing body.</li><li><strong class="progress">12%</strong>Souls benefit from manifesting a shard of their light as a human on Earth. It is an opportunity to develop less evolved aspects of the Soul’s Hierarchy and contribute to the evolution of humanity.</li><li><strong class="progress">12%</strong>The important thing to remember is that all earthly experiences are transmutable and can always be evolved in a way that brings spiritual evolution to the Soul.</li><li><strong class="progress">16%</strong>The first dimension is home to the mineral kingdom. Creation begins at the embryonic stage and gradually develops into form. All creation in this dimension has consciousness and is connected to and part of the Divine Source.</li><li><strong class="progress">16%</strong>The second dimension is home to the plant/vegetable kingdom. In the second dimension creation enters the next level of development. It begins to take its first steps on the path of experiencing itself by entering into the cycles of living: birth, death and rebirth.</li><li><strong class="progress">16%</strong>The third dimension can easily be understood as the animal kingdom. The third dimension develops consciousness further into a level of self consciousness. Creation develops an attachment to its life and thus develops the Will to Survive. Such attachment creates awareness of that which may damage or end life and thus fear is born.</li><li><strong class="progress">17%</strong>Humans exist in the third dimension or lower levels of the fourth dimension until they evolve themselves beyond their primary focus on survival and desire to survive,</li><li><strong class="progress">17%</strong>The purpose of the Earth/physical level of the Hierarchy is to house the first, second and third dimensions thus creating a foundation for the Hierarchy to evolve aspects of itself, for example, a human initiate, into higher states of consciousness.</li><li><strong class="progress">17%</strong>When a person chooses to move into the higher levels of the fourth dimension he/she enters into a whole new phase of learning and experience where the belief systems and behaviours that governed the old life of the third and lower fourth dimensions are stripped away.</li><li><strong class="progress">18%</strong>Ether – ‘A hypothetical medium formerly believed to fill all space and to support the propagation of electromagnetic waves. Greek myth: The upper regions of the atmosphere; clear sky or heaven.’ Etheric – (adjective). Ethereal – ‘Extremely delicate or refined; exquisite. Almost as light as air; impalpable; airy. Celestial or spiritual.’ 1 (1. Collins English Dictionary, (Harper Collins Publishers, Glasgow Great Brittan, 2003)</li><li><strong class="progress">18%</strong>What is certain is that whether it takes years, decades or centuries, changes will occur in the mindset of humanity creating connection with higher states of consciousness. The etheric realm is something that we will eventually come to know intimately as a natural function of evolution.</li><li><strong class="progress">18%</strong>The fourth dimension is known as the Human Kingdom, as the abilities and sensibilities a person aligns to in the fourth dimension reflect the truer nature of humanity</li><li><strong class="progress">19%</strong>the Incarnated Self, the Higher Self and Incarnation Team takes care to meet your physical needs according to what you have chosen for your earthly experience. This level reads how you are and then relays that information back to the Higher Council of Higher Self. The Higher Self monitors how you are coping with the Earth assignment,</li><li><strong class="progress">19%</strong>Your Higher Self is who you are, really, without the learnt behaviours, patterns and beliefs of your earthly personality, or third dimensional self.</li><li><strong class="progress">19%</strong>Your Higher Self is the director of the plan for your physicality and your time upon Earth.</li><li><strong class="progress">19%</strong>The Incarnation Council Working closely with the Higher Self, the Incarnation Council is concerned with manifesting the essence of your Soul into your human form, and into a blueprint and life plan upon Earth’s floor.</li><li><strong class="progress">19%</strong>You, the Incarnated Self, can connect with the Incarnation Council in meditation and dreams.</li><li><strong class="progress">21%</strong>The consciousness or awareness that you carry with you in your life on Earth has its origins not within your mind but in a higher level of your Hierarchy.</li><li><strong class="progress">21%</strong>Some people have evolved the Earth-bound part of their mental field to a ‘prayer field’ where the field is continually filled with prayers and the highest focused intentions. (See the book ‘The Secret of Shambhala’ by James Redfield for a deeper understanding of ‘prayer fields’).</li><li><strong class="progress">21%</strong>The Star Core Command channels higher information down into the Lunar Mind of the Human Incarnate. The Lunar Mind is the feminine aspect of the mind responsible for receiving divinely inspired information.</li><li><strong class="progress">22%</strong>Lifting the Vibration of Your Mental Field Sound In your meditations use the vibration of sacred chants to create a force field of sound vibration in and around you. The AUM chant is very powerful and has been used by initiates for centuries.</li><li><strong class="progress">23%</strong>Read spiritual and personal development books as a way of reprogramming your thinking processes.</li><li><strong class="progress">25%</strong>Initiates who have reached this level of their Hierarchy are generally drawn to intense periods of meditation, contemplation and peaceful surroundings as they integrate this high level of awareness.</li><li><strong class="progress">27%</strong>Where the fourth dimension has housed the Human Kingdom and has been a workshop for Human Incarnates to resolve their issues and reconnect to their spiritual selves, the fifth dimension is the Spiritual Kingdom.</li><li><strong class="progress">27%</strong>The doorway to Christ Consciousness, the fifth dimension is the home base of love. It is a dimension that does not carry the duality of love and fear as the fourth dimension does.</li><li><strong class="progress">27%</strong>In the early stages of the fifth dimension the initiate is trained by a Christ Consciousness representative to hold the higher frequencies required in fifth dimensional living.</li><li><strong class="progress">28%</strong>The Sun Level is the attainment of Christ Consciousness or the awareness of the Oneness of all things. The Sun level can be a euphoric experience and a taste of what life will be like for everyone when humanity is fully integrated in this energy and we as a Global/Spiritual Family all live in Christ Consciousness together.</li><li><strong class="progress">29%</strong>In the sixth dimension, the divine initiate leaves behind what remains of his understanding of separateness and prepares to immerse himself in the knowing of the Oneness of God. He recognises the truth of God and understands God to be the Force of Light, the Source of Light, the Oneness, the All that Is.</li><li><strong class="progress">29%</strong>The Shambhala Council vibrates in the same frequency range as the sixth dimension. The Shambhala Council is both at this level and in the core of the Earth, which is not represented on this particular structure. The Shambhala Council consists of Ancient Beings that were on the council prior to the creation of Earth.</li><li><strong class="progress">29%</strong>developing the Shambhala level deeply shifts the Hara system. The Hara region is below the navel and is not one point but an area of light. The Hara is a template for higher consciousness in the human body. Within this template are codes for living in a higher state of alignment to the Divine Will as well as doorways to other dimensions.</li><li><strong class="progress">30%</strong>Referred to as ‘Seventh Heaven’, the seventh dimension is home to many Angelic and Celestial Beings as well as the Universal Levels of the Hierarchy. Once the Master has surrendered to the releasing of himself into the All that Is of the sixth dimension, he may elect to gather himself again into a form of his choosing and rejoin the Community of Light within the seventh dimension.</li><li><strong class="progress">30%</strong>The Ray Being level is part of the Universal level and is connected to the Soul level, the highest part of the Hierarchy. The Ray Being is a manifestation of the Universal Consciousness and because it is at a very high level of the Hierarchy, represents purity and Oneness Consciousness.</li><li><strong class="progress">32%</strong>Earth is still relatively unevolved in terms of reaching its multidimensional capacity. It can hold multiple frequency bands and the energy to access many dimensional planes of creation.</li><li><strong class="progress">34%</strong>The Torch Bearer holds the flame of Vision. This initiate holds the flame of future possibility. Where there is no hope, the Torch Bearer brings faith. The Torch Bearer holds the torch of light through the times of darkness on Earth and lights the way for others.</li><li><strong class="progress">35%</strong>The Circuit Breaker investigates the family consciousness and may look into the past generations of the family. This person will observe her own patterns and beliefs and will seek to transcend them. In transcending her own behaviours she breaks the circuit for future generations.</li><li><strong class="progress">36%</strong>The Way-Shower is a person prepared to ‘go out on a limb’ in order to improve his/her life and contribute to the world. This person is prepared to take risks regardless of the judgement he may receive from others. Over Earth’s history, some Way-Showers have been persecuted, jailed and in some cases put to death.</li><li><strong class="progress">36%</strong>A Light-Worker is a person who is aligned to the highest plan for Earth. The person works consciously to assist humanity and Earth to realise this divine plan.</li><li><strong class="progress">36%</strong>Light-Worker training goes hand in hand with the Ascension process. The function of the training is to assist the initiate to be consciously aware of her assignments and purpose on Earth. It is to teach her to channel divine love and light on a day to day basis in every situation. The Light-Worker is required and will be tested to attain levels of compassion, empathy, care and consideration for all living things.</li><li><strong class="progress">37%</strong>When he ascends he moves from a third dimensional energy and framework into the fifth dimension which is the Gateway of the Christ Consciousness. The fourth dimension is the transitional plane that assists him to integrate the principles of Christ Consciousness and taste many of its frequencies before entering completely into the power, intensity and love of this energy.</li><li><strong class="progress">38%</strong>Once an incarnate decides to embrace this fear of power, greatness and God, and to move toward embracing his inner power, the blueprint begins to activate even more deeply and intensely.</li><li><strong class="progress">38%</strong>A person, who may not have previously been overly concerned with spiritual development, begins to read metaphysical material, attend workshops of a spiritual basis, and seek the counsel of those already involved in stages of their awakening process.</li><li><strong class="progress">39%</strong>He realises that as he hurts others, he hurts himself and vice versa.</li><li><strong class="progress">40%</strong>He realises, at least in theory, that he is an aspect of the whole, of the Oneness of All that Is. He awakens to the understanding that with a connection to the rest of the Hierarchy, he can truly experience himself as whole. The incarnate reconnects with his Higher Mind/Higher Self and moves into conscious awareness of his multidimensional form.</li><li><strong class="progress">40%</strong>In the Third Stage of Ascension the incarnate enters a series of initiations and training programs designed by the Hierarchy. These programs change the vibrational frequency of the initiate so that he has the capacity to hold higher sets of frequencies simultaneously.</li><li><strong class="progress">42%</strong>Focusing on Light is definitely the strongest technique as Ascension is about transforming the physical self with Light and becoming Light.
