        h2 True beauty with an even more beautiful ending
        p #{dateFull}

    p This book is a masterpiece filled with metaphorical poetry. It holds many wonderful insights. I received the Dutch translation as a gift. Funny thing is, the final chapter, written by the translator puts the reader's feet back on the ground. Yes, the book is a masterpiece, but the idea you may have of the spiritual American-Arabic writer may be different from who he was in reality. For example, Gibran lived in Boston since he was 12 and eventually left the world as an alcoholic. 
    
    p The translator, Désanne van Brederode, writes about her own life and her experience growing up in a new-age environment where the search for spirituality was colored by glimpses of hypocrisy. At the same time, she explains how true spirituality was found in corners where you would least expect it. This, in my opinion, was the most beautiful and eye-opening concluding chapter of any spiritual book I've read to date.
